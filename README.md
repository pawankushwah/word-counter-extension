# Selected Word Counter Chrome Extension

A simple and lightweight Chrome extension that helps you quickly count the number of words in any text you select on a webpage. No need to copy and paste, or open a separate application!

## ‚ú® Features

* **Real-time Word Count:** Instantly displays the word count of selected text directly on the webpage.

* **Non-intrusive Display:** The word count appears in a small, discreet box in the bottom-right corner of your browser window, fading out when no text is selected.

* **Popup Functionality:** Still offers a traditional popup view (by clicking the extension icon) for the selected word count, if preferred.

* **Lightweight & Fast:** Designed to be efficient and not slow down your browsing experience.

Follow these steps to install the extension in your Chrome browser:

1. **Download/Clone:**

   * If you're using Git, clone the repository:

     ```
     git clone <repository_url>
